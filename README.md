## What I've Learned

While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Besides that, I was introduced to NodeJS, ExpressJS, and EJS (for dynamic content). What made this experience even more enriching is that it was my first time working with a non-relational database, using MongoDB with Mongoose for data handling. Moreover, this project was my introduction to the MERN stack :). Exploring and integrating these technologies for the first time added an extra layer of excitement to the learning journey. I really liked using the MERN stack, and I'm excited to work on more projects with it in the future.
